; Player names end with 0xFF, so you can choose up to 7 characters
; freely but must end with 0xFF. The 0xFF should immediately follow the
; last character you choose. So for example, to make your name MAY, you 
; would use letter1=0xC7, letter2=0xBC, letter3=0xD3, and letter4=0xFF
; and you would select start=0. There would be no need to use start=1
