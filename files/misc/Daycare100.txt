;This code instantly levels the Pokemon in Daycare slots 1 & 2 to 100, by adding a sufficient number steps to the counter to cap out any Pokemon's EXP. You can use it with either 1 or 2 Pokemon at a time. Just insert desired Pokemon, execute code, and take them out.

;NOTE: You will need to pay $100 + $100 per level, and any moves learned along the way will overwrite current moves. So prepare Pokemon\Money accordingly.
