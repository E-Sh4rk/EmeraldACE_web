; This code must be executed after any code that uses the exit code CertificateFullENG.
; You should not modify the names of the boxes 11-14 between (they are the same for this code).
; Then, put any pokemon with the name [x♂zN 6FFxC] in the box 10 slot 20.
; At this point, you should save your game and reload your save in order to reinitialize the value of some registers.
; Then, write this code (boxes 1-10) and execute it by triggering ACE with your Thumb ACE species.
; The pokemon in box 10 slot 20 will be transformed into a bad egg.
; This bad egg must be placed somewhere in Box 12 (not the first row), Box 13 or Box 14
; when you want to execute an ARM ACE code by using a Thumb ACE species.

; NOTE: If you plan to use this code with 0x40E9, be aware that the 0x40E9 species is only stable
; in its non-shiny form, thus you shouldn't obtain 0x40E9 with the code "Create Pokemon species from nothing".
; If you want a stable shiny Thumb ACE species, you can use 0x45BB, however only the move and contest summary pages
; are stable, so you might need to open the summary of an adjacent pokemon, go to the moves page,
; and then switch to the 0x45BB moves page to avoid a crash).
