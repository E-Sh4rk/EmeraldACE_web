; This code can be executed both if you already have an active roamer or not,
; either way the chosen roamer will be active.
; Features such as PID and IVs will be the ones from the last active roamer.
; If you activated the roamer with this code you'll not see it in the Pokédex untill you do
; some kind of refresh, such as going indoor or flying somewhere
; The species you must look the area for is still the regular roamer species, not the new one.
